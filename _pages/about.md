Hi, my name is Luyu Liu (he/his/him); the pronunciation is "Loo-yu Li-eu" ([listen in Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ru&text=loo-yu%20leiu&op=translate)). Please feel free to call me Luyu, even if you are my students!

I am a Postdoc Researcher in Transportation at the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida. I graduated as a PhD in Geographic Information Science from the Department of Geography at the Ohio State University. I identify myself as a transportation geographer, a mobility data scientist, and a GISer.


## Research Interests
My research goals are to promote sustainable and resilient mobility from a social equity perspective. Empirically, my interests are urban transport geography, primarily in public transport and micromobility. The core of my research questions is to mitigate and overcome car dependency in cities and to promote sustainability, accessibility, and social equity. Several problems I am interested in:
* How to overcome car dependency in car-oriented cities?
* How does climate change impact public transit and transit users?
* How to improve accessibility and equity in transportation?

## Methodology
My primary solutions are GIS and urban computing techniques; I also used statistics and geostatistics. I believe in data-driven approach and [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor); I developed a dissertation on how to advance mobility and accessibility research with real-time high-resolution data, which are naturally of much larger volume and more heterogeneity.

I am also a keen supporter for web-based GIS due to its convenient, accessible, and open-source friendly nature. I love making accessible or innovative web-maps in [different contexts](/projects).

## Beyond research
I love good humor, different subcultures, and Wikipedia. My recent obsessions are [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne) and [2010s songs adapted to 1980s style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLjNTTCVat0).  

I love making friends so feel free to email me anytime, always glad to chat!
