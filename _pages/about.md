Hi, my name is Luyu Liu (he/his/him), pronouced ["Loo-yu Lieu"](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=loo-yu%20leiu&op=translate). I am a Ph.D. student in geographic information science (GIS) at Department of Geography, The Ohio State University. I am a geographer, a GISer, and a mobility data scientist. 


## Research Interests
Empirically, my current research focus on public transit, micro-mobility, urban mobilty and accessibility issues, and the social equity implications of human mobility. There are several questions I am intersted in:
* How can accessible information and communciation technoclogies (ICT) impact different population?
* What is the role of emerging transportation modes and what are their relationship with traditional ones?
* How to overcome car dependency in car-oriented cities?

## Methodology
My primary solutions to mobility issues are GIS and urban computing techniques; I also used statistics and geostatistics. I believe in big data and [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor): my methods are usually simplistic in nature and easy to understand, but manipulate enormous amount of data. Just like [Andrew Ng](https://analyticsindiamag.com/big-data-to-good-data-andrew-ng-urges-ml-community-to-be-more-data-centric-and-less-model-centric/) suggested, I think no predicting results from any sophisticated models can outperform an accurately measured retrospective or real-time dataset.

I am also a keen supporter for web-based GIS, for it is convenient, accessible, and new comer friendly. I love make accessible and easy-to-use web-maps in [different contexts](/projects)

## Beyond research
I love good humor, different [subcultures](/posts/2021-04-10-watchmojo-luyu), and Wikipedia. My recent obsessions are [Riichi Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong), [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne), and [2010s songs adapted to 1980s style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLjNTTCVat0). I love making friends and that's the most important, so feel free to email me anytime!
