Hi, my name is Luyu Liu (he/his/him); the pronunciation is "Loo-yu Li-eu" ([listen in Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ru&text=loo-yu%20leiu&op=translate)). Please call me Luyu, even if you are my students! I lead the EcoTrans Lab at Auburn, and I am actively recruiting PhD and Master's students, please feel free to send me your CV if you are interested!

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Geosciences at Auburn University. I received my PhD in Geographic Information Science from the Department of Geography at the Ohio State University. I identify myself as a transportation geographer, a mobility data scientist, and a GISer.


## Research Interests
My research aims to promote sustainable, resilient, and people-centered mobility — primarily through public transportation and emerging transportation — by leveraging innovations in urban transport geography. My primary solutions are machine learning, real-time data analytics, and GIS techniques to solve these empirical questions. I believe in data-driven approach and [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor). 

I am also a keen supporter of web-based GIS for its convenient, accessible, and open-source friendly nature. I love making accessible and innovative web-maps in [different contexts](/projects).

## Beyond research
I love good humor, maps, and Wikipedia. I have a tuxedo cat called Alipay.
