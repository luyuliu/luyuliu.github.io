## Introduction
The ability to visualize large amounts of information in real time on interactive maps has never been more important for GI scientists and specialists.  Web-based and open-source platforms, such as the mapping library leaflet and the noSQL database MongoDB, are becoming more popular and useful for their real-time functionality. This workshop will serve as an introductory technical training on full-stack geo-visualization. The workshop will include an overview of web-based platforms, mapping libraries, and the backend infrastructure. During this interactive and hands-on session, all participants will have a chance to build a small web map project with a provided data pack. The whole process of programming and debugging will be demonstrated. There will be time for both development and answering questions that participants may have.

This workshop was organized by Luyu Liu as a part of UCGIS workshop 2021 series on Friday June 11, 2021, 2:00 - 4:00 pm EDT (11:00 am - 1:00 pm PDT).

You can find the instruction and all the materials we used in the workshop [here](https://github.com/luyuliu/UCGIS-Fullstack-Geovisualization-Workshop) and the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEEc_jbamPY). You should be able to reproduce all the results by simply following the instruction. The PowerPoint file I used in the video is in the `/doc` folder or [download here](https://luyuliu.github.io/UCGIS-Fullstack-Geovisualization-Workshop/doc/presentation.pptx). 

## Assessment
Perhaps the most underrated part of teaching is assessment. Assessment is important primarily because it can make you teach better in the future. I learned this after taking many pedagogy classes; however, the actual reason that pushed me to do systematic assessment is that: as a student for almost 20 years, I can strongly feel that many teachers I met just did assessments for administrative purposes (which are surely important), but this should never be the primary reason to conduct your assessment. Instead, I am going to build my assessment based on whether my teaching met the expectation/goals.

For the records, here are the learning objectives/goals/expected outcomes: by the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

- Explain the structure of web pages
- Report HTML, JavaScript, and CSSâ€™s usages
- Reproduce a simple static webmap
- Share the webmap with GitHub Pages
- Report the functions of an API (for backend part only)
- Reproduce a simple back-end with MongoDB and python-eve (for backend part only)

So, I designed two short polls that will be launched before and after the workshop. 

First is the pre-workshop poll. It has five questions:
1. How would you rate your web programming skill? (Selecting from Extremely good, Very good, Somewhat good, Not so good, and Not good at all)
2. How confident would you rate yourself to finish a webmap independently?
3. How would you rate the pre-workshop material?
4. Which materials do you find most useful so far? Please check all that apply. (Selecting from Instruction, Emails, YouTube Video, Slack, and Not helpful at all)
5. Please check the prerequisites you finished.

Second is the post-workshop poll. It has 10 questions:
1. How would you rate your web programming skill after the workshop?
2. How confident would you be on finishing a webmap independently after the workshop?
3. Generally, how would you rate the instructor's ability to help your learning process during the workshop?
4. How would you rate the instructor's public speaking skill?
5. How would you rate the lectures?
6. How would you rate the labs?
7. Do you think the learning objectives are reached after the workshop?
8. How would you rate the organization of the workshop?
9. Do you think the questions during the workshop (can be asked by other students) are answered?
10. How do you rate the instructor's time control?

There are several purposes for these two polls:
1. First and the most importantly, I want to test whether my teaching has helped the participants improve their web-programming skills. Therefore, I asked the same questions in the pre- and post-workshop. Examples are questions 1, 2 in the pre-workshop poll and 1, 2, and 7 in the post-workshop polls. The idea is to compare the self-reported measure before and after to get a semi-quantitative result.
2. I want to ask about the materials, structure, public speaking and other differnet aspects of the workshop and the instructor. These includes questions 3, 4 in the pre-workshop poll and question 3 - 10 in the post-workshop poll.
3. I want to double-check that the participants have prepared all the prerequisites for the labs before the workshop. The example is question 5 in pre-workshop poll.

Both polls were anonymous. I also referred to the rubric of micro-teaching activities used in the College Teaching class (ESEPSY 7404) I took when I was designing the polls. The class was taught by Dr. Shirley Yu, so special thanks to her.

## Results
You can find the poll results in `\doc\poll_analysis.xlsx` or [download here](https://luyuliu.github.io/UCGIS-Fullstack-Geovisualization-Workshop/doc/poll_analysis.xlsx). We are going to analyze the results based on two dimensions: assessment of learning outcomes and the instructor.

### Learning outcomes
The results show that the learning outcomes have been met after the workshop. There are several self-reported results we can use to support this claim.

1. Comparison between self-reported results
