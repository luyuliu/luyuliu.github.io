The ability to visualize large amounts of information in real time on interactive maps has never been more important for GI scientists and specialists.  Web-based and open-source platforms, such as the mapping library leaflet and the noSQL database MongoDB, are becoming more popular and useful for their real-time functionality. This workshop will serve as an introductory technical training on full-stack geo-visualization. The workshop will include an overview of web-based platforms, mapping libraries, and the backend infrastructure. During this interactive and hands-on session, all participants will have a chance to build a small web map project with a provided data pack. The whole process of programming and debugging will be demonstrated. There will be time for both development and answering questions that participants may have.

Prerequisite Knowledge and Workshop Requirements: Participants will be most successful if they are familiar with at least the basics of GIS, programming in general (no specific language or web experience necessary), and some database knowledge (if you wish continue the back-end section of beyond this workshop).  Details about the installation of applications for both the first part (front-end) and second part (back-end) will be provided to the participants a few weeks prior to the workshop.
