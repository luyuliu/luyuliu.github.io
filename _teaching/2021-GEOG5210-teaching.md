This course introduces principles of geographic information systems (GIS) and their applications in spatial analysis and information management. The course is designed to give students an understanding of cutting-edge geospatial technologies, their capabilities, uses, and limitations. Representative applications for each discipline area are demonstrated in the computer laboratory portion. (placeholder, will update later)

Course learning outcomes
======
By the end of this course, students should successfully be able to: 
* Communicate the applicability of GIS and spatial analysis in the present day. 
* Create geospatial data from scratch or from existing geospatial data sources. 
* Workwith geospatial data, including access, management, and manipulation spatial data.
* Utilize spatial functions and operations in the manipulation of spatial data, as appropriate to various contexts.
* Generate sharable outputs resulting from geospatial analyses, including in cartographic form using basic mapping principles.
* Connect concepts learned in class to real world problems, workflows, and solutions.
