I won't do top 10 but I can do a quick top 3 for every subcultures I love. 

# Top 3 good movies:
I love a good movie and a cup of hot 2% milk during a peaceful night.
* Full Metal Jacket. The true horror of war. 
* The last emperor. Underrated masterpiece.
* Dr. Strangelove. I can walk!!

# Top 3 bad movies
These may not be necessarily bad movies, so it can be especially unfair for Rodriguez.
* Spy kids 3. I just love hating on this movie so much that this is my No.1 favorite bad movie.
* 2012. It's so entertainingly bad and I watched it a lot. Love the accuracy tho.
* Snakes on a Plane. What can I say, the title says all.

# Top 3 good pop songs
* Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. I hate the movie.
* High hopes by Pink Floyd.
* Innocence by Avril Lavigne. What can I say.

# Top 3 classic music
Classic music is a fake concept. If you say "I love Bach and Beethoven sooo much" to a 19th century man it's like saying your favorite pop songs are bohemian Rhapsody and Innocence. But if you must say so, I will go with:
* Waltz No.2 by my man Dmitri Shostakovich aka Russian Harry Potter
* Dies Irae from Verdi's requiem. I play this to stay awake
* Hungarian Dance No. 5. These are kinda cliche but I will call them classic classic music
* Going home by Kenny G. Now you know how that 19th century man feels

# Top 3 Vines
* Whoever throwed that paper... by Public school Samuel Jackson
* "ROAD WORK AHEAD" yeah I sure hope it does. by a random guy driving
* Country boy, I looooooove you, (aaaaa) by midwest goddess

# Top 3 paintings
* Neoclassicism: Grande Odalisque by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. It's like 19th century anime
* Northern renaissance: The Ambassadors by Holbein. No spoiler but this is like the most interesting painting ever
* Baroque: De Nachtwacht by Rembrandt van Rijn

# Top 3 video games
* Red Dead Redemption 2. The best video game you can play on this planet. 
* Bloodborne. This is a 2015 game and I am still playing it to this day.
* The Last of Us Part II. Yes, just part II. I am not that into part 1 but I really love part 2.

# Top 3 anime
I don't watch anime so I don't know much.
* Death Note
* Neon Genesis Evangelion
* Kill La Kill

# Top 3 animation movies
Animation movies always have much higher quality than bangumi animes, so I figure I will list another one for animation movies.
* Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
* The Animatrix (2003)
* Paprika (2006)
